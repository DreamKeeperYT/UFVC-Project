    <h1>Reference Questions</h1>
    <p>
        These questions guide the research and design decisions behind UFVWealth and UFVCoin,
        ensuring the platform remains fair, secure, legal, and useful for the UFV community.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="overview">

    <h2>Reference Question 1</h2>
    <p><strong>
        How can UFVCoin ensure fairness and protect financially vulnerable students while encouraging investment and participation?
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        UFVWealth must protect students by keeping UFVCoin focused on learning and campus utility rather than profit pressure.
        Fairness requires allowing students to participate without needing to spend large amounts of money.
        This includes safe spending limits, clear risk warnings, and free ways to earn coins through volunteering, workshops,
        and engagement activities. Rewards (scholarships, raffles, discounts) should be based on participation—not wealth—
        so lower-income students are not disadvantaged.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference Question 2</h2>
    <p><strong>
        What legal, tax, and security regulations must be followed when implementing a university-based cryptocurrency like UFVCoin?
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        UFVWealth must follow regulations related to consumer protection, privacy, taxation, and security.
        If UFVCoin is marketed as an investment with expected profit, it may trigger securities regulations, so it should be positioned
        as a campus utility token used for tuition, parking, cafeteria, transportation, and books. Tax rules must be considered when users
        buy, earn, or spend coins. Strong cybersecurity controls are also essential because the app will handle real money and student accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference Question 3</h2>
    <p><strong>
        How should UFVWealth govern UFVCoin’s supply, rewards, and commission system to prevent manipulation, maintain transparency,
        and ensure long-term trust in the campus community?
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        Because UFVWealth uses a commission model (example: $100 deposit gives 99 UFVC because $1 goes to the platform/community),
        the system must clearly explain where funds go and how rewards are distributed. Governance rules should define who controls coin supply,
        how scholarships and giveaways are funded, and how cooperative staking rewards are calculated. Transparency dashboards and audit logs can
        help prevent misuse, unfair advantage for early users, or hidden changes to the system that could break trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference Question 4</h2>
    <p><strong>
        How can UFVCoin maintain stable usefulness for campus payments (tuition, parking, cafeteria, books) while balancing demand,
        preventing price volatility, and keeping the system simple for students?
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        Since UFVCoin is meant for real campus payments, students need predictable value and an easy user experience.
        The platform should avoid hype-based price swings by focusing on utility, setting clear rules for coin pricing,
        and limiting speculative trading. A stable model also makes it easier to use UFVCoin for day-to-day purchases and scholarships.
        Keeping the system simple (clear pricing, simple wallet design, visible fees) will increase adoption and prevent confusion or misuse.
