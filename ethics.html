<h1>Ethical Analysis of UFVCoin</h1>
<p>Applying the nine ethical theories to show why UFVCoin is a responsible, community-focused initiative.</p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
<!-- List of 9 ethical theories as before, same format -->
<h2>1. Subjective Relativism</h2>
<p></strong> According to Subjective Relativism, morality is based on an individual’s personal beliefs and opinions. From this perspective, whether UFVCoin is ethical depends on how each person views it. Some students and staff may consider UFVCoin ethical because it helps them learn about investing, develop financial literacy, and participate in a trusted campus community. They may feel empowered by having control over their financial decisions and see the coin as a positive educational tool. However, others may believe UFVCoin is unethical if they view cryptocurrency as risky, unstable, or potentially encouraging poor financial choices. If someone personally feels uncomfortable with crypto or believes it could harm students financially, they may judge it negatively. Therefore, under Subjective Relativism, UFVCoin’s morality varies from person to person based on individual opinions and experiences</p>

<h2>2. Cultural Relativism</h2>
<p></strong> Cultural Relativism suggests that morality is determined by the values and norms of a particular culture or community. In the context of UFV, if the university culture values innovation, financial literacy, student collaboration, and responsible investing, then UFVCoin could be seen as ethical because it aligns with those shared values. If the campus community supports new technologies and educational opportunities in finance, the coin would reflect and reinforce those cultural priorities. However, if the broader community or university culture views cryptocurrency as speculative, unsafe, or inconsistent with institutional goals, then UFVCoin may be considered unethical. Under Cultural Relativism, the morality of UFVCoin depends on whether it aligns with the collective beliefs and standards of the UFV community.</p>

<h2>3. Divine Command</h2>
<p>In the term of Divine Command Theory, some religions follow teachings from God and a few of those teachings involve helping others, supporting our community, responsibility, etc. Our UFV coin can follow these values by using the profits to support crypto owners and pool profits. We can use this app and coin to teach students and staff these important teachings. This coin will help people learn responsibility by managing their coin and finances. These teachings will help crypto owners not only during their time at UFV but after as well. We can also use the profits to help our UFV community whether that be donating to the food bank, fundraisers, or even supporting the creation of new programs to support UFV students and staff. Overall, our UFV coin can help promote these important religious teachings. </p>

<h2>4. Ethical Egoism</h2>
<p>In the terms of Ethical Egoism, creating our own crypto coin positions UFV to be a leader in this field. Because no other university currently offers a crypto coin, this gives UFV a unique competitive advantage. More students and staff will be drawn UFV to participate in the coin. Additionally, it may attract investors who are interested in investing in our coin and university. This will strengthen UFV’s reputation and establish it as one of the top universities. Additionally, expanding to other universities will further strengthen UFV’s leadership position and influence. Creating our own crypto coin will satisfy UFV’s self interest to increase its financial success, influence and reputation. Overall, this will satisfy the University’s goals. </p>

<h2>5. Kantianism</h2>
<p>Kantianism is based on the "Categorical Imperative," which suggests that we should only act according to rules that we would want to become universal laws, and that we must treat people as ends in themselves rather than a means to an end. Under this theory, UFVCoin is ethical because it is built on a foundation of honesty and respect for the student. Unlike traditional crypto platforms that often rely on "greater fool" dynamics—where one person's profit requires another's loss—UFVCoin is a "Circular Economy" designed for utility. If this model were universalized, it would create a stable, non-exploitative financial system. Furthermore, by using Mark Carney’s donation to fund a non-profit app, UFV is treating students as "ends" (the ultimate goal of the project) rather than "means" (a source of profit for a bank). By providing financial literacy and transparency, the app respects the autonomy of the UFV community, allowing them to make rational, informed decisions about their own wealth. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, the UFVCoin initiative is a moral duty to empower and educate the student body.</p>

<h2>6. Act Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>Act Utilitarianism argues that an action is ethical if it results in the "greatest good for the greatest number" of people. In the context of the UFVWealth app, the ethical value is measured by the total happiness and utility generated for the campus community. Traditional savings accounts offer very low interest rates, providing minimal "good" to the student, whereas UFVCoin provides immediate, tangible benefits such as discounts on tuition, parking, and cafeteria food. Because the initiative is non-profit, 100% of the "blank cheque" donation is funneled back into student rewards, scholarships, and giveaways, maximizing the collective benefit. Additionally, the app encourages "Positive Externalities" through its cooperative staking program; when students earn coins by volunteering or attending sessions, both the individual and the UFV community gain value. By prioritizing the welfare of students, employees, and alumni over corporate profit, UFVCoin successfully fulfills the Utilitarian goal of producing the highest possible level of community wellbeing.</p>

<h2>7. Rule Utilitarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Universal student crypto programs improve financial literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Univefvkldsanrsal programs could create gambling risks.</p>

<h2>8a. Social Contract Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Follows rules for student benefit, contributes to common good.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Violating trust or restricting access.</p>

<h2>8b. Rawls’ Theory of Justice</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Supports all students, especially least advantaged.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Only wealthy students gain benefits.</p>

<h2>9. Virtue Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Encourages responsibility, generosity, and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Focused only on personal gain, ignores ethical behavior.</p>
