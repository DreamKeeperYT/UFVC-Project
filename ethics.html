<h1>Ethical Analysis of UFVCoin</h1>
<p>Applying the nine ethical theories to show why UFVCoin is a responsible, community-focused initiative.</p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
<!-- List of 9 ethical theories as before, same format -->
<h2>1. Subjective Relativism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Individuals may view UFVCoin as ethical if it helps them save money, learn investing, or participate in a trusted student community.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Some may feel UFVCoin is risky or unnecessary, seeing it as potentially encouraging poor financial choices.</p>

<h2>2. Cultural Relativism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> In UFV culture, promoting financial literacy, student collaboration, and responsible investing aligns with community values.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If the broader community views crypto as speculative or unsafe.</p>

<h2>3. Divine Command</h2>
<p>In the term of Divine Command Theory, some religions follow teachings from God and a few of those teachings involve helping others, supporting our community, responsibility, etc. Our UFV coin can follow these values by using the profits to support crypto owners and pool profits. We can use this app and coin to teach students and staff these important teachings. This coin will help people learn responsibility by managing their coin and finances. These teachings will help crypto owners not only during their time at UFV but after as well. We can also use the profits to help our UFV community whether that be donating to the food bank, fundraisers, or even supporting the creation of new programs to support UFV students and staff. Overall, our UFV coin can help promote these important religious teachings. </p>

<h2>4. Ethical Egoism</h2>
<p>In the terms of Ethical Egoism, creating our own crypto coin positions UFV to be a leader in this field. Because no other university currently offers a crypto coin, this gives UFV a unique competitive advantage. More students and staff will be drawn UFV to participate in the coin. Additionally, it may attract investors who are interested in investing in our coin and university. This will strengthen UFV’s reputation and establish it as one of the top universities. Additionally, expanding to other universities will further strengthen UFV’s leadership position and influence. Creating our own crypto coin will satisfy UFV’s self interest to increase its financial success, influence and reputation. Overall, this will satisfy the University’s goals. </p>

<h2>5. Kantianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Treats students as ends, provides meaningful opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Exploiting students for profit violates principles.</p>

<h2>6. Act Utilitarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Increases overall happiness through rewards, learning, community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Causes stress or financial loss for some students.</p>

<h2>7. Rule Utilitarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Universal student crypto programs improve financial literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Univefvkldsanrsal programs could create gambling risks.</p>

<h2>8a. Social Contract Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Follows rules for student benefit, contributes to common good.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Violating trust or restricting access.</p>

<h2>8b. Rawls’ Theory of Justice</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Supports all students, especially least advantaged.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Only wealthy students gain benefits.</p>

<h2>9. Virtue Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Encourages responsibility, generosity, and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Focused only on personal gain, ignores ethical behavior.</p>
