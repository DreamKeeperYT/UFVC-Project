    <h1>Ethical Analysis of UFVCoin</h1>
    <p>Applying the nine ethical theories to show why UFVCoin is a responsible, community-focused initiative.</p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
<h2>1. Subjective Relativism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Individuals may view UFVCoin as ethical if it helps them save money, learn investing, or participate in a trusted student community.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Some may feel UFVCoin is risky or unnecessary, seeing it as potentially encouraging poor financial choices, which makes it unethical for them personally.</p>

<h2>2. Cultural Relativism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> In UFV culture, promoting financial literacy, student collaboration, and responsible investing aligns with community values, making UFVCoin ethical.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If the broader community views crypto as speculative or unsafe, UFVCoin may be considered unethical from a societal standpoint.</p>

<h2>3. Divine Command</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> If UFVCoin promotes fairness, supports students, and encourages sharing wealth, it aligns with values of helping others and can be seen as ethically positive.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If mismanaged, UFVCoin could harm students financially, which may conflict with moral teachings about protecting and supporting the vulnerable.</p>

<h2>4. Ethical Egoism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin benefits the university and stakeholders, allowing users to gain rewards, learn investing, and grow their wealth, aligning with self-interest.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If the app only benefited developers or the university, and caused financial risk for students, it would be unethical from an egoist perspective.</p>

<h2>5. Kantianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin treats students as ends by providing meaningful opportunities to invest, learn, and participate in a transparent system.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If students were exploited or misled for profit, UFVCoin would violate Kantian principles by using people merely as a means to an end.</p>

<h2>6. Act Utilitarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin increases overall happiness by giving students rewards, financial learning, and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If the coin caused stress or financial loss for some students, the overall happiness would decrease, making it unethical under this theory.</p>

<h2>7. Rule Utilitarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> If all universities offered similar student crypto programs, it would likely improve student financial literacy and happiness globally.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If a universal rule of university crypto programs led to exploitation or gambling risks, it would be unethical under rule utilitarianism.</p>

<h2>8a. Social Contract Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin follows rules designed for student benefit, respecting rights and contributing to the common good.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> Violating trust or unfairly restricting access would break the social contract, making the program unethical.</p>

<h2>8b. Rawls’ Theory of Justice</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin benefits all students and especially supports the least advantaged by offering rewards, scholarships, and opportunities to learn investing.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If only wealthy students gained benefits while vulnerable students were excluded, it would violate Rawls’ principles.</p>

<h2>9. Virtue Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Ethical:</strong> UFVCoin encourages virtues like responsibility, generosity, and community engagement through volunteering and cooperative rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ethical:</strong> If students only focused on personal gain and ignored ethical investing or sharing, UFVCoin would not foster virtuous behavior.</p>
