          </summary>

          <p>
            To manage on campus transactions, our payment processors would need
            to consider our coin’s volatility and implement some strategies to
            complete successful transactions. We would need to implement
            strategies to calculate and handle payment. Below are a few
            strategies often used by other big crypto coins like Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Strategies to calculate payment:</strong><br />
            Real time exchange conversions
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Strategies to handle payment:</strong><br />
            Use of a stablecoin<br />
            Conversion to fiat currency
          </p>

          <h3>Real Time Exchange Conversions</h3>

          <p>
            Real time exchange conversion is when payment processors will
            process the transaction based on the coin’s price at the time of
            purchase. The payment processor will instantly get the coin’s
            current market value, lock it in and use that price for the
            transaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example,<br />
            Tim Hortons will have a steep tea priced at $2. Chacha asks to pay
            with our UFV coin. The employee will select our UFV coin as the
            selected payment, and the payment processor will instantly get the
            coin’s current price. The processor will convert $2 to the
            equivalent UFV coin amount and display that price. The price will be
            locked in while Chacha pays for the transaction. This is to prevent
            price fluctuations while the transaction is being paid for.
          </p>

          <h3>Use of a Stablecoin</h3>

          <p>
            Stablecoins are coins “being pegged to fiat currencies”(Team,
            Speed,2025), such as the US or Canadian dollar. After the
            transaction, the payment processor will immediately convert the UFV
            coin to a stablecoin. A benefit of using a stablecoin is to allow
            the merchants/university to receive payment “within the crypto
            ecosystem”(Team, Speed,2025) while still being safe from the coin’s
            volatility.
          </p>

          <p>For example,</p>

          <p>
            When Chacha’s payment is received, the UFV coin is immediately
            converted to a stablecoin. Tim Horton will have received $2 worth of
            a stablecoin in their account. Now Time hortons doesn’t have to
            worry about their revenue increasing or decreasing while still
            holding crypto.
          </p>

          <h3>Conversion to Fiat Currency</h3>

          <p>
            Similar to stablecoin, the merchant can decide to instead have their
            revenue be immediately converted to a fiat currency such as Canadian
            dollars. A UFV merchant or the university itself, may prefer to
            receive payments in Canadian dollars rather than hold crypto. After
            the transaction, the payment processor will immediately convert the
            UFV coin into Canadian dollars.
          </p>

          <p>For example,</p>

          <p>
            When Chacha’s payment is received, the UFV coin is immediately
            converted to Canadian dollars. Tim Horton will have received $2
            Canadian dollars in their account. Now Time hortons doesn’t have to
            worry about their revenue increasing or decreasing due to crypto
            prices and holds their revenue in Canadian dollars.
          </p>

          <p>
            These methods allow students and staff to use our UFV coin for
            payment while minimizing the impact of the coin’s volatility.
