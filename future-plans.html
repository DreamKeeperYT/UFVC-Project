<p>Exploring future growth opportunities for UFVC</p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
<h2>Will we open/allow investments to other non-UFV stakeholders afterwards?</h2>
        <p>
          Allowing non-UFV stakeholders to invest will bring in more funding into UFV. Thai money can be used to grow and expand the university, improve facilities, support new programs and even provide scholarships for students. 
<br><br>
UFV’s visibility and credibility will also increase. It will establish UFV as an innovative university, which will strengthen its reputation and leadership position in this field. This can potentially lead to partnerships or collaborations with other businesses, universities or communities. 
<br> <br> 
Allowing more investors will increase the coin’s value over time. This will encourage more students to invest and participate in events or activities involving the coin. Students will gain real world experience with investing and learning about cryptocurrency. Because it is a UFV based coin, students will have more resources to learn and it will attract more students to attend our university. Additionally, students can continue to benefit from their investments even after graduation.
<br><br>
We are actively exploring how to make this opportunity possible while ensuring it aligns with UFV’s values and goals.

    <section class="overview">
        <h2>Preferential Offers for UFV Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>To ensure our internal community remains the priority, we have developed a tiered system to reward UFV-verified users. The app would check the user's @ufv.ca or @student.ufv.ca email and assign a tier:</p>

        <h3>1. Verified Identity Tiers</h3>
        <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Stakeholder Group</th>
                    <th>Preferential Offer</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Active Students</strong></td>
                    <td>0% transaction fees for tuition/books and 5% "cashback" in UFVC for cafeteria purchases.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Faculty & Staff</strong></td>
                    <td>Discounted parking rates when paid in UFVC and higher staking rewards for long-term holding.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Alumni</strong></td>
                    <td>Exclusive access to "Alumni Growth Pools" and discounts on UFV continuing education courses.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Future Students</strong></td>
                    <td>Early-access "Scholarship Wallets" where UFV matches a percentage of their initial deposit.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
         <br><br>
        <h3>2. The "UFVWealth" Fee Redirection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Discount:</strong> If a user holds more than 500 UFVC, the $1 "UFVWealth" fee is waived for all on-campus purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>The Circular Economy:</strong> Fees are redirected to a real-time "Community Fund" tracker to fund student raffles and scholarships.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>    
        <h3>3. Proof of Engagement (Incentivized Staking)</h3>
        <p>Boost your returns by participating in the UFV community:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volunteer Multiplier:</strong> Scan a QR code at a UFV volunteer event to increase your staking interest rate (APY) by 0.5% (max 1 event/month).</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Achievement:</strong> High GPA or completion of in-app "Money Management" workshops unlocks "Gold Tier" exchange rates.</li>
        </ul>
         <br><br>
        <h3>4. The Digital Certificate (UFV Legacy NFT)</h3>
        <p>Upon graduation, users receive a <strong>Soulbound Token (SBT)</strong>—a non-transferable NFT that lives in the UFVWealth wallet.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Benefit:</strong> Acts as a "Permanent Preferential Pass." It grants "Legacy" status, allowing alumni to keep buying coins at the student rate.
        </blockquote>
         <br><br>
        <h3>5. Liquidity & Use-Case Restrictions</h3>
        <p>To prevent "pump and dump" schemes from outside investors, we implement <strong>Whitelisting</strong>. UFVC can only be sent to "Verified UFV Merchants" (Parking, Cafeteria, Bookstore), keeping the value strictly within our school economy.</p>
