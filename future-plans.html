<p>Exploring future growth opportunities for UFVC</p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
<h2>Will we open/allow investments to other non-UFV stakeholders afterwards?</h2>
        <p>
          Allowing non-UFV stakeholders to invest will bring in more funding into UFV. Thai money can be used to grow and expand the university, improve facilities, support new programs and even provide scholarships for students. 
<br><br>
UFV’s visibility and credibility will also increase. It will establish UFV as an innovative university, which will strengthen its reputation and leadership position in this field. This can potentially lead to partnerships or collaborations with other businesses, universities or communities. 
<br> <br> 
Allowing more investors will increase the coin’s value over time. This will encourage more students to invest and participate in events or activities involving the coin. Students will gain real world experience with investing and learning about cryptocurrency. Because it is a UFV based coin, students will have more resources to learn and it will attract more students to attend our university. Additionally, students can continue to benefit from their investments even after graduation.
<br><br>
We are actively exploring how to make this opportunity possible while ensuring it aligns with UFV’s values and goals.
